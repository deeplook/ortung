# Ortung

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/deeplook/ortung/master?urlpath=lab) 

This repo is supposed to be used as an online interface to the
[OSS Review Toolkit](https://github.com/heremaps/oss-review-toolkit) (ORT) online.
It's name should give a sense of "law and order" as often associated with the German
word "Achtung!" It is somewhat inspired by http://ortaas.org.

## Preliminary Test

```bash
cd oss-review-toolkit
./cli/build/install/ort/bin/ort --help
```

More to come...
